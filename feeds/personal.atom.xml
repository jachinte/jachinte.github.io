</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been 7 years since I wrote an article on the web. At that time, I was
starting my bachelor, and managed to maintain &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://z-graphics.blogspot.com"&gt;Z-Graphics&lt;/a&gt;, a blog dedicated to help
Blogger users enhance their sites. It was all about minor hacks and tutorials
on web programming and design. Although I must say, it wasn't just about
writing and getting occasional anonymous comments, but the community around it;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blogsconene.blogspot.com"&gt;blogs with Ã±&lt;/a&gt; (blogs in Spanish) was a community of enthusiasts that shared a
common taste for blogging. I met interesting people, and gained 37 readers, of which
3 of them were my own emails ðŸ˜….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the past years I've learnt many things, and it all has come to the point
that sharing is a necessity. I'll be writing about software engineering,
object-oriented programming, and research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you're interested, the technology behind this blog is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;: a static site generator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://foundation.zurb.com"&gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt;: a responsive front-end framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://prismjs.com"&gt;Prism&lt;/a&gt;: a lightweight and extensible syntax highlighter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.npmjs.com"&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bower.io"&gt;bower&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gulpjs.com"&gt;gulp&lt;/a&gt;: tools that make development less complicated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog's template is highly inspired on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://toddmotto.com"&gt;Todd Motto&lt;/a&gt;'s blog.&lt;/p&gt;
